Welcome to the roboroom
-----------------------

In this repository I collected images and code of (very) old projects regarding robotics.

- **Ulisse**: was my first serious project. This robot was built using PVC and the lynxmotion tracks. The rover had a pan-camera with infrared sensors. The controller was a PIC16F Microchip which I programmed from scratch. The wireless communication was obtained through two Xbee modules. I also realised a basic control interface in Autoit in order to control the robot from a laptop.

- **Ulisse v2**: was an improved version of Ulisse. It had aluminium body which made it lighter and faster. The electronic control board and comunication interface were the same of the first version (cannibalized).

- **Tarasco**: it is (still alive) a six-wheels robot controlled through a Raspberry-pi. The robot has its own webserver which allows controlling it using a browser. The camera streem is obtained through a modified webcam which has been connected to the USB port of the Raspberry.

- **Exoskeleton**: it is a miniaturized board containing an IMU and an Arduino mini which has been used to record the movement of patients wearing an exoskeleton for leg rehabilitation.

- **Neural**: images and Python code (Tensorflow) for a simplified "neural turret" used as an example in a tutorial on Neural Networks.
